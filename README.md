# FinalProject
Team Tropical Twirl Presents: Bilingual Buddies. A project by: Alex McMichael, Carlos Lobrea, Lowell Belany, and Sam Cassidy


#Vision
The Bilingual Buddies began as a vision to push through a barrier of communication called language. The key idea being, if you are new to any country and don't speak the native language our web based social media application will provide plenty of resources for a non native speaker to get started.

# Capabilities

A user can register for an account, write a bio, choose a native/preferred language and at the same time check a box to volunteer.

After registration the user is routed to the home page with navigation bar at the top. A user can then: Check for alerts, comment on posts in the news feed, search for other users, add friends on the searched user profile, join a team, look at resources and look at account details.

From the Account details drop down  menu a user can: Look at teams/groups, create a team/group, edit their profile where languages can be added or removed; as well as create new posts, and lastly from the account details drop down menu a user can log out.

# Lessons Learned
* Git Branching
* Spell-Check
* Naming Convetions(Angular and java naming consistency)
* Websites are challenging
* Creating interesting projects are Challenging
* Needed better feature prioritization 


#Future Implementations
* Use a Language api parse all text on the website to one of the languages
in the api that we located.

* Admin Super User with full CRUD(create update Delete) abilities on the web application

- Meetup events, where a user can create and invite other users to a meetup

- User can see meetups on a calender

- Owner of a team/group can send join requests, rename the group/team, delete comments from within the team/group, and remove users

- Add a location api for the meetup location as designated spots
